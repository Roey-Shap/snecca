# snecca
A snake-like puzzle game where you have to break the rules to proceed.

IMPORTANT NOTE! This is simply a dump of a few important pieces of code from this game, which I made a long while back.
It used Juju Adam's incredible "Scribble" since, at the time, I didn't have a better homebrew option. It can be found here:

This code does not include every game file, but most of the crucial ones.
